# Community-Interactions-using-Spark-GraphX

Graphs are the fundamental way to build and define relations between objects to form networks of nodes and vertexes. Some popular examples of Graphs could be found beneath the construction of popular social media sites like Facebook, to online maps like Google maps. Graph analysis hence become imperative in understanding the complex graphs to find significant relations, like friend recommendation feature in Facebook, to finding shortest path between two locations in Maps. 
The project would demonstrate the effective exploratory analysis of Graphs using GraphX running on top of the fast cluster computing platform, Spark. The dataset would consist of call details record from Telecom Italia mobile users (available from Dandelion Open big data website), which contain the information of the aggregated anonymized call records based on the calls exchanged in the city of Milan. 
The dataset presents an ideal case study to implement the various features of GraphX, which are listed below:

- Build Graph structure out of the dataset
- Perform exploratory analysis of the structure using various Spark GraphX operators and inbuilt algorithms to understand the level and strength of interactions between different areas within the city.  
- Extraction of features and Graph Visualization for further analysis.

The outcomes of the analysis could enable the providers to make business decisions regarding sales, promotions and engineering details to improve the quality of services. Owing to the size of the dataset, the call interactions corresponding to single day would be used for exploring the Spark GraphX features. The language used for graph building and data exploration would be Scala since Spark operations details in Apache Spark Guide are available in Scala.
